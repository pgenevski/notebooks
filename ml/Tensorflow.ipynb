    "\n",
    "Computational graphs are composed of Values and Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Values (tensors)\n",
    "Values are always n-rank tensors (scalar, vector, matrix ...) with a given shape and dtype. Depending on their role in the computation they can be:\n",
    "* **[tf.constant](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/constant)** - these tensors are not supposed to change\n",
    "* **[tf.placeholder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder)** - used to feed data into the computational graph (e.g. using a Python generator). Only shape is known in advance, but not value.\n",
    "* **[tf.Variable](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable)** - these are the model parameters that will be optimized. Usually initialized randomly at the beginning of the computation. Because of the automatic differentiation (aka backpropagation), Tensorflow will automatically compute the gradients of a specified function (e.g. loss) with respect to all variables in the graph (unless told not to do this for some variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Strictly speaking, in tensorflow terminology, the above three are also operations that return tensors.\n",

    "### Operations\n",
    "[Operations](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Operation) are used to perform computations with tensors. They  take $m \\in [1, \\infty)$ tensors as input and produce $n \\in [1,\\infty)$ tensors as output. Inputs to operations can be Values or outputs from other operations."
